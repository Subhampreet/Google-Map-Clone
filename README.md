<b>Mapbox</b> is an incredibly powerful tool for creating any map based applications, but it can be pretty daunting to get started with. This Project fetches Data from the Mapbox. It also uses the browser's <b>geolocation API as well as Mapbox plugins</b>. The features included in this project are:

- Navigation through-out the Real-Time World Map.
- The Application Displays the shortest path between two destinations, and also the time taken by different mode of transport.
